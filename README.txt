Hello, this project was done during the summer semester of Operating Systems at Texas State University.

Clone the repo in a safe directory that you can easily navigate to:
Run the following command to execute using python in Linux:

python assign4.py

You should then input your requested number of frames, and both algorithms will output.
The output includes the string for that given frame, and the entire frame.

ATTENTION:
If you do not see the difference in Fault Rate between algorithms, try a lower number of pages.
